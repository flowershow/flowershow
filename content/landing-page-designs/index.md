# Landing Page Design Explorations

Three visual directions for the new Flowershow homepage. Same content from the homepage draft, radically different design treatments.

## Option A — Editorial

Inspired by Ghost and iA Writer. Libre Baskerville serif headings, warm cream background, generous whitespace. The page reads like a magazine spread — typographic weight does the work, no decoration.

## Option B — Kinetic

Inspired by Vercel and Linear. Full dark mode on slate-950, Inter at its tightest and boldest, orange gradient accent on key words. Full-viewport hero with status pill and dual CTAs. Bento-style feature grid. Speed and confidence as felt qualities.

## Option C — Warm Minimal

The synthesis — neither fully editorial nor fully product. Source Sans 3 (humanist, warmer than Inter), soft stone tones with subtle paper-grain texture, terracotta accent. Two-column "Why Now" layout with sticky heading. Masonry-inspired community gallery.
