## 🚀 Quick Start: Publish Your Blog

Follow these simple steps to turn your Obsidian notes into a live blog:

1. **Create a blog folder inside your Obsidian vault.**

For example `/blog`. Each Markdown file inside it will become a blog post.

Add posts with frontmatter like:
```yaml
---
title: My First Post
description: A short summary of the post.
date: 2025-10-08
authors: [you]
---
```

2. **Add a blog index page.**

Create a new file, for example `/blog/README.md`, and add the List component:

```
---
title: My Blog
---

<List dir="/blog" />
```

3. **Sync your vault to GitHub**.
4. **Connect your repository on** [**Flowershow Cloud**](https://flowershow.app) — your blog will be built and published automatically.
5. **Customize your theme, domain and more!**
