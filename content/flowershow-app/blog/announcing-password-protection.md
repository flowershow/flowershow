Password protection is now available for all **Premium** Flowershow sites!

## Why Password Protection?

Not everything needs to be public. Sometimes you want to:

- **Share work-in-progress** with a select group of reviewers
- **Publish internal documentation** for your team or organization
- **Create private knowledge bases** accessible only to members
- **Test your site** before making it publicly available
- **Share sensitive content** with trusted collaborators

## How It Works

Password protection is simple and straightforward:

1. **One password for the entire site** - Set a single password that protects all pages
2. **Instant access** - Once visitors enter the correct password, they can browse freely
3. **No user accounts needed** - Just share the password with people you trust

## Setting Up Password Protection

Enabling password protection takes just a few seconds:

1. Go to your Flowershow dashboard
2. Open your premium site settings
3. Enable password protection
4. Set your desired password
5. Save your changes

That's it!

## Security Considerations

While password protection adds a layer of privacy, keep in mind:

- **Share passwords securely** - Use secure channels to share the password
- **Change passwords regularly** - Update your password periodically, especially if shared widely
- **Not for highly sensitive data** - For maximum security, consider additional measures for truly confidential information
