We are excited to announce that **Flowershow** now supports raw `.html` file publishing! 🚀

## The Simple Pitch

"I have an HTML file. I want a URL."

That's it. That's the feature.

**Why this is useful (The Old Way vs. New Way)**

Before, if you wanted a custom page, you had to paste HTML blocks into Markdown.
But if you had a *full page*—like something exported from a tool or generated by AI—it was painful:
*   You had to use `layout: plain` frontmatter.
*   You had to deal with Markdown formatting errors breaking your HTML.
*   You had to constantly check if the parser stripped your styles.

It was brittle.

**The New Way:**
Flowershow now supports publishing raw `.html` files directly.

Sometimes you don't have a Markdown file. Sometimes you have:
*   A portfolio page where you hand-coded every pixel.
*   A complex report or dashboard exported from a data tool.
*   A custom landing page that needs a specific structure.

In these cases, converting to Markdown feels wrong. You want the file exactly as it is.

**Now, you can just publish it.**

## How to use it

Just use the dashboard, or our CLI:

```
flowershow publish index.html
```

It serves the file as-is, preserving your exact look and feel.

If you have a simple page you want to share, you can do it right now.

> [!note]
> URLs currently require the file extension. For `index.html`, share the link as `.../index.html`.

Happy Publishing! 🌺
