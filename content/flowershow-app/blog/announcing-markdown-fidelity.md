When we created **Flowershow**, our mission was simple:

> Let people publish beautiful websites quickly and easily from Markdown — without changing how they write.

Today, we’re marking an important milestone in that mission:

**Flowershow now supports full CommonMark + GitHub-Flavored Markdown spec.**

That means:

**💪 Full CommonMark + GFM support**
- Headings, paragraphs, line breaks  
- Lists (ordered + unordered)  
- Blockquotes  
- Code blocks + syntax highlighting  
- Inline code + emphasis  
- Links + autolinks  
- Images  
- Tables
- Footnotes
- Task lists
- Strikethrough
- Emoji & shortcodes  
- HTML inline tags

If Markdown renders correctly in CommonMark-compliant tools, GitHub, or modern editors, it should now “just work” in Flowershow.

**✨ Extended Markdown features**
- Obsidian Wikilinks, embeds and Callouts
- Math equations
- Mermaid charts
- Text highlighting

## 🎯 Why this matters

Markdown began as a lightweight writing format — today it powers blogs, docs, wikis, digital gardens, academic notes, and engineering knowledge bases.

But historically, every platform has implemented Markdown a little differently.

That leads to friction:

Write in one tool → fix formatting in another → adjust for your website → tweak again for GitHub…

Flowershow aims to fix that.
- Write once using most popular Markdown flavors: CommonMark and GFM
- Publish
- Keep the exact meaning & formatting you wrote

Markdown is the open web’s content layer — and Flowershow treats it that way.

## 🧭 What’s next: Deep Obsidian integration

CommonMark + GFM was just Stage 1.

Next, we're doubling down on Obsidian-native features:

Coming soon:

* 📎 **Note transclusions** (`![[my-note]]`)
* 🧩 **Canvas publishing + embeds**
* 🧠 **Obsidian Bases support**
* 💬 **Obsidian-style comments (%%…%%)**
* 🎨 Better support for Excalidraw
* 🧘‍♀️ Seamless publishing experience

If your workflow lives in Obsidian —
Flowershow is evolving to be **the publishing engine your vault deserves.**
