We're excited to announce the launch of our official [flowershow/themes](https://github.com/flowershow/themes) repository! It's a dedicated space where we'll be maintaining a curated collection of CSS themes that you can use to customize the look of your Flowershow site.

## How to Use Flowershow Themes

You can use a theme by configuring it in your site's `config.json` file. There are two ways to specify a theme:

### 1. Use Latest Version of an Official Theme

If you want to always use the latest version of a theme, simply specify the theme name:

```json
{
  "theme": "letterpress"
}
```

### 2. Use a Specific Version of an Official Theme

If you prefer to lock your site to a specific theme version, you can specify it using the `@` syntax:

```json
{
  "theme": "letterpress@v0.0.2"
}
```

## Contributing to Flowershow Themes

The Flowershow themes repository is open source, and we warmly welcome contributions from the community! There are several ways you can contribute:

1. **Improve Existing Themes**: Found a bug or have an idea to enhance an existing theme? Submit a PR with your fixes or improvements.

2. **Create New Themes**: Have a cool custom CSS that you've created for your own Flowershow site? We'd love to include it in our official collection! Create a new theme and submit it via PR.

3. **Report Issues**: Using a theme and found something that could be better? Open an issue to let us know.

All contributions help make Flowershow better for everyone in the community, whether it's fixing a small CSS bug or creating an entirely new theme.
