Here we review the existing options for publishing an Obsidian vault, including official Obsidian Publish and the major alternatives.

In general, the main division is between approaches where the site creation and hosting are done for you (like Obsidian Publish and Flowershow Cloud) and approaches that are self-hosted options where you need to build and then host the published site and options.

Amongst the self-hosted options there are roughly three main methods:

- NextJS or similar static site generator where you use a full service static site generator to generate the site from the markdown files in the Obsidian vault. This is the approach of Flowershow self-hosted and Quartz
- Obsidian plugin where site rendering is done within a plugin
- Scripted conversion to a static site (usually python). This is like a simplified version of the first option where 

# Options

![[Pasted image 20220815165038.png]]

### Pros

- previews on hover

- graph view
- possible password protection
- in form of Obsidian plugin
- you can select the notes you want to publish (set in frontmatter)

## obsidian-zola

A no-brainer solution to turning your Obsidian PKM into a Zola site.

- 🔗 https://peteryuen.netlify.app/
- 📣 Jan 2022 - https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/s2vecw/a_quick_way_to_share_your_obsidian_pkm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
- ⭐ 241 https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola
- 💤 Still developed
- 💻 Python + some static CSS and JS

![[Pasted image 20220815154515.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220815174022.png]]

### Pros

- one-file setup and very easy to publish on netlify: only requires `netlify.toml` (with content copied from their example) to be added to Obsidian vault (+ of course Netlify setup)
- the above file also serves as a config file (see screenshot below), so you pass all the config as environment variables (not sure what are benefits/drawbacks of this)
  ![[Pasted image 20220815160117.png]]
- Fusion 360 embeds ![[Pasted image 20220815201204.png]]

### Cons

- looks like Obsidian (on purpose, the author wanted to keep it simple)
- you can only configure a few elements on the page (again, using netlify.toml, where you can even write some HTML strings, which is a bit weird...)

## Perlite

A web-based markdown viewer optimized for Obsidian

![[assets/Pasted image 20220823164330.png]]

### Pros

- has a simple GUI program (for Windows) that you can run inside the folder you want to publish; you can set the name and assets folder; it will convert your content dir to static siteoutput dir (HTML, JS) and drag and drop your output directory in netlify
- search: full-text but also filename, tags
- button "Share now" to share current page
- flexibility to choose the notes to list in pubsidian

### Cons

- raw look, not website-like
- menu is just an alphabetical list of all notes
- graph can't handle too many nodes
- if you want to set some tags or unpublish a note you need to find it in a list of nodes (autogenerated) ![[Pasted image 20220814214316.png]]
