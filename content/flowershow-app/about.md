## What we built

Flowershow is a markdown publishing platform. Drop your files — or connect a GitHub repo, use the CLI, or publish from Obsidian — and get a live, hosted website in seconds. No build pipelines, no CMS configuration, no deploy scripts. Just content and a URL.

The core promise is speed and simplicity. From file to URL in seconds, beautiful by default, zero configuration required. Your content stays in plain markdown files you own — no lock-in, Git-integrable, durable. Flowershow is infrastructure, not a silo.

We started building it because we needed it ourselves. We've been building content and data-driven websites for over a decade, and markdown had become our preferred medium for almost everything — internal notes, client work, research, documentation. But publishing that markdown was always painful. Too many steps, too much configuration, too much to maintain. Every project meant reinventing the same pipeline.

So we built the tool we wished existed. Flowershow started as an internal scaffold for markdown-driven sites, absorbed the features we kept wanting — Obsidian wiki links, mermaid diagrams, LaTeX, graph views — and eventually became something we thought a wider community could benefit from. So we opened it up.

## Why now

Content is moving faster than ever. AI writes drafts in seconds. Research accumulates in tools like Obsidian overnight. Teams produce more in a day than they used to in a week.

Publishing infrastructure hasn't kept up. Setting up a website still means choosing a framework, configuring a build pipeline, picking a CMS, wiring up a deploy script — and that's before you've written a word. The tools we use to share ideas were designed for a world that no longer exists.

Flowershow is what you'd build if you started from scratch today. The whole workflow is: drop your content, get a URL. Fast because it should be. Simple because complexity is our problem, not yours.

And increasingly, the person publishing isn't a person at all — it's an agent, a script, a pipeline. Flowershow works for that too. The same simplicity that makes it fast for humans makes it easy to automate.

We think of this as publishing rebuilt for the AI age. Not because AI is a feature, but because the speed and volume of content creation today demands infrastructure that can keep up.

## The bigger picture

### Why publishing tools matter

Tools matter. Not in a abstract, obvious way — in a specific, consequential way.

The ability to publish and share ideas quickly, easily, and reliably shapes what gets shared and what doesn't. It shapes whose voice carries and whose gets lost to friction. It shapes whether knowledge compounds across people and time, or stays locked in private notes and internal drives.

We believe that better publishing tools are part of better collective sensemaking — our shared ability to understand reality, process complexity, and build on each other's thinking.

This might sound like a large claim for a markdown publisher. But the connection is direct: you can't build on ideas that aren't shared. You can't share ideas that are painful to publish. Reduce the friction, and more gets out. More gets read. More gets built on.

### The markdown foundation

Markdown is the right foundation for this. Not because it's the most sophisticated format — it isn't — but because it's composable, durable, and human-readable. History of computing shows that simple, open formats outlast sophisticated, proprietary ones. Markdown will still be here in twenty years. The notes you write today in Obsidian or a plain text editor will be readable by any tool that exists then.

That durability matters. When you publish with Flowershow, your content isn't locked into a database or a proprietary CMS format. It's files. Yours. Forever.

### Open over walled

We believe the web works better as an open ecosystem than a collection of walled platforms. Publishing on your own URL — even a free flowershow.app subdomain — is meaningfully different from posting to a platform that can change its algorithm, lock you out, or disappear. It's a small act of digital independence, and it adds up.

This connects to the broader mission: Flowershow is one part of what a healthy, open publishing infrastructure looks like. We're building it because we think it matters, and because nobody else was building it quite the way we wanted it to exist.

Rufus is an entrepreneur and technologist who has spent twenty years working on data platforms, open knowledge, and the infrastructure of how ideas flow. He is the founder of the Open Knowledge Foundation and Datopian, and has worked with governments, businesses, and nonprofits across the world. He studied Mathematics at Cambridge and holds a PhD in Economics. He started Flowershow because publishing markdown should be as easy as sending a tweet.

### Ola Rubaj

Ola is a front-end developer with a sharp eye for detail and a genuine love of elegant interfaces. She built most of what makes Flowershow look and feel the way it does. When she's not writing code she's reading, and she has a thing for flowers.

## Why the name?

A flower show is where you exhibit your garden to the world — the carefully cultivated things you've grown, put on display for others to see and appreciate. Flowershow does that for your ideas. Your notes, your research, your writing: we give them a venue.
