We launched `/changelog` on the Flowershow site.

V1 implementation:

- changelog entries in `content/flowershow-app/changelog/`
- filename convention `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
- listing query rendered with an Obsidian Bases block
- newest-first sorting based on filename date prefix

Next iteration will focus on optional auto-generation from release signals.
