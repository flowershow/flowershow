Layout/component images ARE optimized via `next/image`.\n\n### 1. Markdown/Content Image Rendering Path\n\n**Pipeline** (`lib/markdown.ts`):\n1. Remark plugins process markdown → AST\n2. `remarkObsidianImageSize` extracts width/height from Obsidian alt-text syntax\n3. `rehypeResolveHtmlUrls` resolves relative paths to absolute URLs\n4. `rehypeUnwrapParagraphsAroundMedia` removes `\u003cp\u003e` wrappers around images\n5. Final output: **plain HTML `\u003cimg\u003e` tags** (NOT next/image)\n\n**Key files**:\n- `lib/markdown.ts` - MDX processing config\n- `lib/remark-obsidian-image-size.ts` - Obsidian image sizing\n- `lib/rehype-resolve-html-urls.ts` - URL resolution\n- `components/public/mdx/fs-image.tsx` - Image wrapper (optimization DISABLED per #1013)\n- `components/public/mdx/mdx-components-factory.tsx` - `img` component is COMMENTED OUT\n\n**Why disabled**: Issue #1013 - bugs with private sites, HTML+Tailwind, Obsidian sizing. Reverted pending RFC #984.\n\n### 2. next/image Usages (All properly configured)\n\n| File | Props | Status |\n|------|-------|--------|\n| `components/public/hero.tsx:89-96` | width=1200, height=800, fetchPriority=\"high\" | ✅ |\n| `components/public/nav.tsx:65-71` | width=32, height=32 | ✅ |\n| `components/public/layouts/blog.tsx:104-113` | fill=true, sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 1152px, 100vw\" | ✅ |\n| `components/public/mdx/list.tsx:142-151` | width=1200, height=800 | ✅ |\n| `components/public/mdx/obsidian-base-cards.tsx:268-277` | fill=true, sizes=\"${cardSize}px\" | ✅ |\n| `components/dashboard/blur-image.tsx` | Forwards all props | ⚠️ Caller dependent |\n| `components/dashboard/nav.tsx:84` | width=32, height=32 | ✅ |\n| `components/dashboard/profile.tsx:14-23` | width=40, height=40 | ✅ |\n| `app/(cloud)/login/page.tsx:17-23` | width=48, height=48 | ✅ |\n\n### 3. Configuration\n\n`next.config.mjs`:\n```js\nimages: { remotePatterns: [{ hostname: '*' }] }\n```\n- Allows images from any domain\n- No custom loader (uses Vercel default)\n\n### 4. Key Issues\n\n1. **Markdown images bypass optimization** - FsImage returns `\u003cimg\u003e`, not `\u003cImage\u003e`\n2. **No srcset/sizes on content images** - Original file always downloaded\n3. **Image geometry unknown at render time** - See issue #978\n\n### 5. Related Issues/PRs\n\n- **RFC #984**: Image optimization plan (open PR with `rfcs/image-optimization.md`)\n- **Issue #978**: Store image geometry at upload time (OPEN)\n- **Issue #1013**: Disable optimization until edge cases handled (CLOSED - optimization reverted)\n\n### 6. Validation Pages for Metrics\n\nRepresentative pages to test:\n- Any markdown page with embedded images\n- Blog post pages with featured images\n- Obsidian Bases views with card images\n- Custom landing pages with HTML images\n\n### 7. Baseline Metrics\n\n**Cannot measure LCP/transfer bytes without running the site.** Recommend:\n1. Run dev server and use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse\n2. Or use production URL with PageSpeed Insights\n\n**Expected baseline issues**:\n- Content images: No srcset, full-size downloads regardless of viewport\n- LCP likely degraded on image-heavy pages","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"52197250+olayway@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T00:53:11.160007+01:00","created_by":"Ola Rubaj","updated_at":"2026-02-15T01:02:47.671298+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T02:33:30.486895+01:00","close_reason":"Audit complete, metrics deferred","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flowershow-kpm.1","depends_on_id":"flowershow-kpm","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-13T00:53:11.169344+01:00","created_by":"Ola Rubaj"}]}
