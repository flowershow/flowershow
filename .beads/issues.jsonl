{"id":"flowershow-8af","title":"Typesense collection not created for CLI/Obsidian/anon publish paths","description":"Sites created or published via CLI, Obsidian plugin, or anonymous publish endpoints use API routes directly (POST /api/sites, POST /api/sites/id/:siteId/files, POST /api/sites/id/:siteId/sync, POST /api/sites/publish-anon) instead of the Inngest syncSite function. The Inngest path creates the Typesense collection before uploading files (inngest/functions.ts:99-104), but none of the API endpoints do. When the Cloudflare worker processes these uploads and tries to upsert documents into Typesense, the collection doesn't exist. The worker silently swallows the error (worker.js indexInTypesense catch block) and marks the blob as SUCCESS anyway, so search never works for these sites.\n\nFix: Add createSiteCollection() calls to all 4 API endpoints that create or publish sites without going through Inngest.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"52197250+olayway@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:15:42.179579+01:00","created_by":"Ola Rubaj","updated_at":"2026-02-12T19:37:03.385626+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-12T19:37:03.385626+01:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
