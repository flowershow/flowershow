# Competitor Comparison Content Plan

> Status: Stub (for review before research)
> Date: 2026-02-21

## Goal

Define a repeatable plan for Flowershow comparison pages/posts (for example, "Flowershow vs GitBook") that support SEO discovery and help buyers evaluate options quickly.

## Brief

It is standard in product marketing and SEO to publish comparison content against leading alternatives. The intent is to capture high-intent searches (for example, "X vs Y", "Y alternatives"), clarify positioning, and reduce decision friction with transparent feature/cost/use-case comparisons.

## Initial Scope (Draft)

- Create a comparison content format/template that can be reused.
- Prioritize high-interest competitors (starting with GitBook and similar tools).
- Define what "good comparison content" means for Flowershow (honest tradeoffs, clear ICP fit, actionable next step).

## Proposed Outline (Pre-Research)

1. Problem framing and who each tool is for
2. Quick summary table (best for, pricing model, setup effort, customization, hosting model)
3. Detailed side-by-side by category
4. Where Flowershow is stronger
5. Where alternatives are stronger
6. Migration/switching guidance
7. Decision rubric ("choose X if...")
8. CTA to try Flowershow

## Open Questions

- Which competitors should be in wave 1 (top 3-5)?
- Should comparisons live as docs pages, blog posts, or both?
- What evidence do we need per claim (docs links, benchmarks, screenshots)?
- How do we keep pages current as competitor features/pricing change?

## Next Step

After review of this stub, run targeted research on comparison-page best practices and strong examples, then revise this plan with a concrete publishing playbook.
