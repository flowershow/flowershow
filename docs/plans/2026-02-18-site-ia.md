# Flowershow Site Information Architecture

> Status: Draft — agreed Feb 2026
> Based on: brand-strategy.md, brand-audit-2026-02-13.md

## Context

This IA redesign follows from the brand strategy work completed in early 2026. The core
problem: the current site has a fragmented nav (8+ top-level items), no narrative layer
between the practical promise and the philosophical vision, and use-case pages buried
alongside product pages without a coherent grouping.

Key brand strategy decisions driving this IA:
- Lead with the practical promise (A+C: speed + time saved), narrative underneath (D)
- Three layers of attention: hero → why now → collective sensemaking
- Self-hosted is off the table — simplify to Cloud + CLI publishing paths
- About page rewritten and published (currently excluded)

## Homepage Structure

New scroll sequence replacing the current feature-list layout:

1. **Hero**
   Tagline: "Content to URL. Instantly." (or "Markdown to website in seconds")
   Subhead: stop wrestling with build pipelines, CMS configs, and deploy scripts.
   CTA: Start publishing (free forever) | Demo video

2. **Ways to Publish**
   Visual, scannable section: drag & drop / GitHub / CLI / Obsidian plugin
   Links to `/github`, `/publish`, `/use-cases/obsidian`

3. **Features Grid**
   Instant deployment, folder-based publishing, markdown-native, hosted for you,
   own your content, custom domains & themes

4. **"Why Now" Narrative Section** *(new — the D layer)*
   2–4 sentences on "publishing rebuilt for the AI age"
   Ends with a link to the full story on `/about`

5. **Use Cases Teaser**
   Cards grid: Obsidian, Blogs, Knowledge Bases, Landing Pages, Data Stories, Wikis,
   AI Publishing — each linking to its `/use-cases/*` page

6. **Community Showcase**
   Keep as-is — 12 live community sites, strong social proof

7. **Newsletter Signup**
   Keep as-is

8. **Final CTA**
   Dark banner — "Start using Flowershow today"

## About Page Structure (rewrite)

The About page becomes a three-act narrative, progressing through the three layers
of the brand strategy:

**Act 1 — What we built**
Brief. The practical promise. Points back to the homepage. Sets up the "but why?" question.

**Act 2 — Why now**
The D-layer narrative: content moves faster than ever, publishing infrastructure hasn't
kept up, Flowershow is what you'd build if you started from scratch today.
This is the "manifesto" — no separate `/manifesto` page needed.

**Act 3 — The bigger picture**
The existing collective sensemaking argument, the markdown revolution, why publishing
tools matter for how we think together. The philosophical depth for the audience that
wants it.

## Redirects Required

| From | To |
|---|---|
| `/blogs` | `/use-cases/blogs` |
| `/data-stories` | `/use-cases/data-stories` |

Existing redirects to preserve:
- `/docs/site-wide-toc` → `/docs/sidebar`
- `/blog/how-to-set-up-blog` → `/blog/how-to-publish-blog`

---

## Open Questions / Future Work

- **`/github` page** — does GitHub-based publishing need its own full landing page
  (like `/publish`), or is a section in docs sufficient? Defer until `/publish` pattern
  is validated.
- **Use Cases index page** — grid/gallery or editorial? Recommend gallery with a one-line
  description per use case and a hero image.
- **Obsidian use case** — the existing about page anchors in 2022-era digital garden
  culture. The new Obsidian page should update that framing while still speaking to
  the audience.
- **CLI nav visibility** — `/publish` is a useful shareable URL but not in nav. Monitor
  whether it needs more prominence (e.g. in the footer or a "developer" section).
