# Flowershow Site Information Architecture

> Status: Draft — agreed Feb 2026
> Based on: brand-strategy.md, brand-audit-2026-02-13.md

## Context

This IA redesign follows from the brand strategy work completed in early 2026. The core
problem: the current site has a fragmented nav (8+ top-level items), no narrative layer
between the practical promise and the philosophical vision, and use-case pages buried
alongside product pages without a coherent grouping.

Key brand strategy decisions driving this IA:
- Lead with the practical promise (A+C: speed + time saved), narrative underneath (D)
- Three layers of attention: hero → why now → collective sensemaking
- Self-hosted is off the table — simplify to Cloud + CLI publishing paths
- About page rewritten and published (currently excluded)

## Homepage Structure

New scroll sequence replacing the current feature-list layout:

1. **Hero**
   Tagline: "Content to URL. Instantly." (or "Markdown to website in seconds")
   Subhead: aspiration first ("fastest way to turn markdown into a live website"),
   then pain negation ("no repos, no pipelines, no waiting")
   Pricing nudge: "Free plan — no credit card required"
   Stats bar: e.g. "1,000+ users · X,000 sites published"
   CTA: Start publishing free | Demo video

2. **Features Grid**
   Instant deployment, folder-based publishing, markdown-native, hosted for you,
   own your content, custom domains & themes

3. **Themes Showcase** *(new — visual strip)*
   Screenshots of 2–3 named themes side by side. Shown, not told.
   Links to `/themes` for full gallery.

4. **Testimonials** *(new — if/when real quotes available)*
   2–3 short real quotes from community members. Placeholder until sourced.

5. **Ways to Publish**
   Visual, scannable: drag & drop / GitHub / CLI / Obsidian plugin
   Links to `/github`, `/publish`, `/use-cases/obsidian`

6. **"Why Now" Narrative Section** *(new — the D layer)*
   Editorial prose on "publishing rebuilt for the AI age"
   Ends with link to `/about` for the full story

7. **Use Cases Teaser** *(trimmed to 4 cards)*
   Obsidian · Blogs · Knowledge Bases · AI Publishing
   Overflow link: "Also great for: landing pages · data stories · wikis → See all"

8. **Community Showcase**
   12 live community sites — keep as-is

9. **FAQ** *(new — objection handler)*
   4 Q&As: pricing, markdown compatibility, portability, custom domains

10. **Newsletter**
    Repositioned as "not ready yet?" — above final CTA

11. **Final CTA**
    Mirrors hero headline to bookend the page. "Content to URL. Instantly. Free."

## About Page Structure (rewrite)

The About page becomes a three-act narrative, progressing through the three layers
of the brand strategy:

**Act 1 — What we built**
Brief. The practical promise. Points back to the homepage. Sets up the "but why?" question.

**Act 2 — Why now**
The D-layer narrative: content moves faster than ever, publishing infrastructure hasn't
kept up, Flowershow is what you'd build if you started from scratch today.
This is the "manifesto" — no separate `/manifesto` page needed.

**Act 3 — The bigger picture**
The existing collective sensemaking argument, the markdown revolution, why publishing
tools matter for how we think together. The philosophical depth for the audience that
wants it.

## Redirects Required

| From | To |
|---|---|
| `/blogs` | `/use-cases/blogs` |
| `/data-stories` | `/use-cases/data-stories` |

Existing redirects to preserve:
- `/docs/site-wide-toc` → `/docs/sidebar`
- `/blog/how-to-set-up-blog` → `/blog/how-to-publish-blog`

---

## Open Questions / Future Work

- **`/github` page** — does GitHub-based publishing need its own full landing page
  (like `/publish`), or is a section in docs sufficient? Defer until `/publish` pattern
  is validated.
- **Use Cases index page** — grid/gallery or editorial? Recommend gallery with a one-line
  description per use case and a hero image.
- **Obsidian use case** — the existing about page anchors in 2022-era digital garden
  culture. The new Obsidian page should update that framing while still speaking to
  the audience.
- **CLI nav visibility** — `/publish` is a useful shareable URL but not in nav. Monitor
  whether it needs more prominence (e.g. in the footer or a "developer" section).
- **Testimonials** — Section 4 on homepage needs real quotes. Source from GitHub
  Discussions, Discord, or direct outreach before launch.
- **Stats for hero** — confirm real numbers for user count and sites published to
  populate the stats bar. "1,000+ users" is confirmed; sites published figure needed.
- **`/themes` page** — new page needed to replace the current external GitHub link.
  Four official themes: LessFlowery, Letterpress, Superstack, Leaf. Each has a demo
  site (*.flowershow.app) and preview images in github.com/flowershow/themes. Page
  should show screenshot + name + one-liner + demo link + usage instructions (config.json
  snippet). Replace current GitHub nav link with /themes once page exists.
