# Brand Audit: FlowerShow Today

Current positioning: "Markdown to website in seconds" -- a tool-centric, feature-forward pitch. The landing page is essentially a feature list with a demo video. It tells you what FlowerShow does, but not why it matters or what world it's building toward.

## What's working

- The name is memorable and has a nice metaphor (showcasing your digital garden)
- The free tier + simple pricing is clean
- The CLI page ("Turn local files into websites") is actually the strongest copy on the whole site -- it has energy, a clear pain point, and speaks to a workflow
- "Own your content" is a genuinely differentiating value

## What's not working

- The identity is fractured across three products (Cloud, CLI, Self-hosted) without a unifying story
- "Markdown to website" is a how, not a why -- it limits the audience and sounds like a dev tool
- "For geeks who value their time" actively narrows the market and has no emotional resonance
- The landing page reads like a Tailwind UI template filled in with feature bullets -- competent but forgettable
- The About page anchors in 2022-era digital garden culture (Obsidian, Roam) which is already aging
- There's no narrative arc -- no tension, no transformation, no aspiration
- The "bigger picture" (collective sensemaking) is buried on a page nobody reads, and it's actually the most compelling part of the whole brand

## The core tension

FlowerShow is currently about markdown but wants to be about publishing in the AI age. That's not a small pivot -- it's a category shift from "markdown converter" to "content publishing infrastructure."
