This a roadmap for flowershow development that is audience and feature led. Created in Feb 2026.

## By use case

NB: for every "use" case you can mention the different ways you can integrate for publishing e.g. cli, github, drag and drop, UI ... (probably have different emphasis for different use cases e.g. AI is more CLI and API etc)

- "Vercel for content": fast, reliable (one URL per push?)

For X

- For Markdown (just "publish" Markdown)
- For AI: fastest to publish from AI ...
- For Obsidian
- Flowershow for (full-ish) websites
- For blogs
- For newsletters
- For wikis
- Open source: advertise, offer a support / enterprise plan for deployment (??)
- For docs ...
- For product sites: landing + docs + blog + changelog
- For changelogs

Feature-ish

- Themes 🔥🔥 (these matter imo)
	- How to create themes ...
	- Theme for docs
	- Theme for blogs
	- Themes for product sites

## Content calendar

Content calendar can just run off the features ...

- Product Hunt announce
	- What is it we are focusing on for that announce?
## Marketing

> Current North Star for marketing (imo) [Jan 29th]
> 
> - grow traffic to landing page or any page that converts to sign ups
> - get to no 1 or no 2 for key phrases on google (need to research but eg publish markdown is prob a good one)
> 
> Right now, i think we want to start creating a markdeting strategy using my classic prompts and asking it to help us devleop particular personas i.e. user groups / job stories and then we nail a marketing strategy to reach that group with a particular message. What is the pain they have right now and how do we solve that ...
>
> just to take one example: who could we market our blog feature too? what landing page would they need etc etc
>
> another example: we developed the data features but never really marketed that to anyone? who are the users, where are they, what problem od they have and how could we get a message to them
