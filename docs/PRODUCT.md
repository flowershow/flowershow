# Flowershow: Product & Vision

Flowershow is a **markdown publishing platform**. Drop your files — or connect a GitHub repo, or use the CLI — and get a live, hosted website in seconds. No repos to configure, no build pipelines, no deploy scripts. Docs, blogs, knowledge bases, landing pages, team handbooks: anything that starts as markdown.

The core promise is speed and simplicity. From file to URL in seconds, beautiful by default, zero configuration. Content stays in markdown files you own — no lock-in, Git-integrable, durable.

The deeper purpose: publishing matters. The ability to share ideas quickly, easily, and reliably — on an open ecosystem, not a walled platform — is part of how knowledge compounds and how we make sense of the world together. Markdown is the right foundation for this: composable, durable, human-readable. It will still be here in 20 years. Flowershow makes publishing markdown as easy as sending a tweet.
